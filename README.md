repo for code to teach stats


This repo has mostly R code for some basic stats ideas to teach freshmen in community colleges some basic stat applications.  The intent is to show some pictures (in the context of an in class demonstration) where conversations can help get really fresh, new students some (very little perhaps) intuition about what is happening when we compare distrubtions, for example.
