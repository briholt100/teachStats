I wish someone or myself would have been more vigilant in the creation and flow of this piece of the group process. The power point in it self was a representation of our MLV poster, in the since that we used the same ""material"" for it. Right now I can't remember if we had two qualifiable pieces for ""visual aspects"". We played the video and had a picture within the powerpoint. For our audience participation we had wanted to do two question/answer sessions with the class, however I feel that each persons version of a question/answer was different (or, well at least different from my own.) Both the audience participation and the visual elements were discussed collectively. 

All in all, I think that the class presentation could have been way better. I still am in wonder about just how we were supposed to incorporate the MLV poster into the class presentations. As a group, I think, we thought that that meant to just present to the class the same ""material"" and I think we did that, as badly as it may have been I feel that that is what we presented. "

Her enthusiastic participation was consistent; in addition to arriving on-time for all meetings, Mary Ann chose to stay behind (often up at least up to an hour) to accommodate coordinating work with a group member who had notified us of a sudden scheduling conflict.  During Making Learning Visible, she invited about a dozen people to see our presentation and willingly camped out for almost three hours (far longer than the 45-minute shift that our group had settled on).  Her involvement frequently  included playing the text hound, rummaging through the social psychology textbook until she'd found a relevant passage based on a group member's off-chance remark that something was noteworthy in an article or piece.  She also reached out to members regarding what they wanted the project to look like,  and if there was any confusion about how to proceed, Mary Ann would help them be more decisive about what they wanted to contribute.

Although he was sometimes late to meetings or with turning in assessments of our initial research, Chia-Yu helped create a warm, pleasant atmosphere by promoting others' work, asking detailed questions, and offering immediate assistance.  He did not maintain leadership skills that guided others toward successful participation, yet Chia-Yu's efforts always directly pushed the project forward (especially visually, and also with the sourcing and embedding the video we chose)."

Although there wasn't a lot of initiative to self-direct on tasks like peer-reviewing research papers and uploading responses to Google, he was always willing to do what was required when asked.  However, several other team members were more likely to volunteer to perform the duties themselves, and so Shihao did a smaller percentage of the additional effort for completing the group project than others."

In addition to attending all meetings and providing a deep analysis of the articles we read and used for the presentation (often founded on visual imagery and historical basis), I often volunteered to serve as the group's scribe by writing down all that we were discussing for inclusion into the project.  With the group contract, script, and PowerPoint, I exercised initiative by starting Google Docs related to those, inviting everyone to edit, and immediately working on text and images; this pro-active approach may have assisted others with bringing their ideas and artistic works to fruition.  Furthermore, I sought suggestions from all group members to share their insights.  Being a coordinator for our scheduling, setting out steps to be taken, and encouraging others to pursue an opportunity that they were thinking about (such as opening the presentation or speaking for their first time in Symposium) were also major contributions.
