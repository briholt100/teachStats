"1","ALENA N MARKINS","Very assertive, was unclear on the names of interviewees but described their contributions and why they were important. Had done extra research on early police tasked with catching runaway slaves."
"2","ALENA N MARKINS","Once again, I don't remember the details too well, but I do remember them being the one with the most in-depth knowledge, I couldn't tell if they just studied this a lot before or if they worked hard to do a good job in this seminar. I'll never forget what they said about Superman beating up the KKK."
"3","ALENA N MARKINS","Really great job with evidence from the film, they even brought in points from outside the movie! Made for some very interesting conversation "
"4","ALICIA L GEHRING","she spoke a lot during the seminar and they were pretty insightful points and quite different so it was refreshing to hear. but i would expect her to have written the paper at least half way done so that she could be more prepared."
"5","AMY M MASON","Amy is a very good gatekeeper or facilitator. She have a deep understanding about the problem, she even gave us a few life examples regarding about the problem from The 13th. She speaks very clear and provide us with good amount of informations. She also have many point of arguments that are not wrong. "
"6","AMY M MASON","She delivers her opinion clearly and response others friendly. "
"7","BILLY DE-LA-VEGA","I think Billy had a lot of interesting input that helped expand other members group ideas and really helped the conversation progress. He mentioned lots of different parts of 13TH and was able to connect them to social psych concepts. "
"8","BILLY DE-LA-VEGA","Billy gave us many informations from the 13th documentary. He provided us many information that we forgot, and use them as a supporting point for our argument. He is a very good facilitator, gatekeeper, and also text hound (he uses both text and the video of the 13th.) He connects everything we talked smoothly, he also analyzed our arguments and come with good conclusion."
"9","BILLY DE-LA-VEGA","Well thought, and response directly. Friendly and good speaker."
"10","BING-RUI CHANG","Hadn't written the paper yet, and was asking questions that were assignment related to help write that evening. "
"11","BING-RUI CHANG","He was not really ready for the seminar as he thought that the paper was due on midnight and haven't written his paper yet. He had some idea about what he is going to write but he hasn't analyzed the documentary fully yet. So the majority of the time he doesn't contribute a lot. However, he does help the discussion move along by asking questions when the pace is starting to slow down so that is helpful. He will probably do better next time."
"12","BING-RUI CHANG",""
"13","BRYAN L VARGAS","Bryan's read his paper written for the seminar very well, he was clear in his points that they saw psychology references and rhetoric and imagery that was used to stereotype African Americans. He took the time to allow other's to absorb what he was saying and time to allow questions. "
"14","BRYAN L VARGAS","He did talk about his personal experience and relate it to the movie  which add an interesting perspective."
"15","BRYAN L VARGAS","He talked about his family being racist living in all black community. His bais become reality in situation like a shortcut reaction. "
"16","CHIA-YU LIU","I wasn't exactly sure what your essay topic was about. You did not go into as much detail as I would have hoped. You did have to be provoked to talk but you always talked and said good things when asked. I liked that you contributed facts from outside news articles, that was interesting and fun to learn."
"17","CHIA-YU LIU","Daniel had an interesting report in that while it was similar to Dakota's, he brought in a lot of statistical evidence rather than social psychology. For example, he mentioned how 100 unarmed blacks were killed by police in 2015, which was a very large number and helped to contribute to our idea of the movement. He also discussed how stereotypes help to people to justify hiding racism / unfairness. Overall he was somewhat quite, but the points he brought up were strong and contributed to the discussion."
"18","CHIA-YU LIU","Chia-Yu did not talk that much during the discussion, but I could tell that he was definitely staying engaged with everything, because when he did talk, he made some great contributions to what we were discussing. "
"19","CONNOR J PARENTEAU","Connor spoke more so about what was portrayed within the film. Specifically  how stereotyping as well as prejudice were used in history to be used agented the blacks.  "
"20","CONNOR J PARENTEAU","connor focused on his specific point of connection but was able to respond and contribute to other points we talked about. he also provided a lot of insightful information "
"21","DAKOTA V MALBERG-LOEN",""
"22","DAKOTA V MALBERG-LOEN","Dakota's report was similar to some other classmates, but her main idea of the constantly changing / adapting prison system was well though out. She also made an interesting connection to the Standford Prison Experiment and how ""just like the creator of the experiment was so focused on the results he didn't notice the cruelty, some people are so focused on the money / election they don't notice the injustice"", which I found interesting. She also talked about how some people specifically choose to ""see what they want to see"" to influence the prison system and the public. Overall she definitely did her homework and watched the movie to completion. "
"23","DAKOTA V MALBERG-LOEN","Dakota took control and lead the group during the conversation. She did a really nice job of mediating making sure that the conversation kept on moving even when it got slow and she did this by picking different parts of the film that she found interesting and then allowing up to elaborate on her ideas. "
"24","EMILY B DERDA","She did a good job with her evidence and clarity but it was sometimes difficult to understand her"
"25","EMILY B DERDA","Emily is very difficult to understand, both because she speaks at a very low volume and it often seems like her sentences wander. I had a hard time following her train of thought, and due to the fact that she did not speak up much during the discussion, I have a hard time knowing what her depth of knowledge was. When she did speak, it seemed like she understood the subject matter, but I would like to hear more from her in the future. "
"26","EMILY B DERDA","They focused on the demographics of the people and the music; interjected sometimes though trailed off and gave up speaking on occasion. "
"27","ERIKA M GLUNZ","Like, she related lots of social psychological concepts ""stereotyping"", ""conformity"" and related it with the documentary. There was clarity and depth. Well presented."
"28","ERIKA M GLUNZ","Hi Erika, thanks for being a part of our great seminar group!  I was impressed by not only your deep engagement with the 13th as text, but with the enthusiasm you took to delve into the historical, artistic, and personal aspects that were drawn from it.  Your comment about juxtaposition of photographs from poverty-stricken neighborhoods with optimistic, voiced headlines from the Reagan era helped me think about the qualities of media as a message, and discussing why the post-antebellum era would have favored Uncle Remus and his moral, kindly disposition while later rejecting it in favor of the aggressive African male stereotype was enlightening.  Also, thinking through how the Birth of a Nation film blazed the path for ""rebellion"" and tying it back to the social psychology textbook helped our group see that particular chapter in action.  Thanks!"
"29","ERIKA M GLUNZ","You knew the text. You used the text to get into subjects where we could then have conversations about how while there is something we are noticing in the film, and apply analysis."
"30","GABRIELLE M PITZLER","Gabrielle had all of her points in her notebook for us to choose from for discussion. This was really helpful because it not only steered conversation but kept us from repeating points."
"31","GABRIELLE M PITZLER","We were all able to talk and contribute to each other's points and she is no different. She came prepared and she brought up a lot of interesting points. So I have no problem at all, she did well."
"32","KESHA L HOWARD","I believe Kesha spoke from personal experience and didn't need the film to make connections. I sensed passion and conviction in her words that echoed the premise of the film. "
"33","KESHA L HOWARD","Kesha being African American had first had knowledge of the text, there was no need to prepare. Her depth and understanding of what is going on in the text and what it represents, she lives it everyday. Kesha showed conviction when speaking, yet you could see that she too holds strong stereotyping, prejudice of other's of color too. With possible good reasons too. "
"34","KESHA L HOWARD","Kesha did extremely well on the seminar by providing her own experiences and relating it to the text. This turns the seminar into an interesting discussion and I learnt a lot."
"35","MARCELLA V TASLIM","I enjoy that she used personal situation to talk about her relating to treatment to African American. "
"36","MARCELLA V TASLIM","Marcella was able to make a connection to the film and our class work nicely. Her connection was reinforced by her sharing some of her own personal accounts as they applied to the film. Her presentation was clear and focused. "
"37","MARCELLA V TASLIM","Marcella, gave great insight to her own experience of stereotyping along with prejudice that she has experienced being a immigrant without a country. "
"38","MARY-AN VAN-VALKENBURG","For example, Mary An start railing to a different topic but she does talk about one section of the text. She is clearly passionate about the topic but sometimes it just went off the tangent when she start talking about her experience.  She did encourage Kesha to speak up about her opinion which I think is a good thing."
"39","MARY-AN VAN-VALKENBURG","Mary-An was able to make a connection very well. Her points were illustrated well and she used segments of the film to reiterate her position. "
"40","MARY-AN VAN-VALKENBURG","She was very emotional about the treatment of African America and how it relating to today treatment through the Govt."
"41","NEHEMIHA M DANIEL","He brought up a few things about the film I missed, the last 30 mins seemed like propaganda to him and I completely didn't pick up on that"
"42","NEHEMIHA M DANIEL","This student did  a good job of having knowledge of the text and film but generally stayed in a narrow mindset of the subject. Stayed in one general area of the topic rather than discussing more of the subject more broadly."
"43","NOOR O SHAHIN","She talked a lot about the movie making techniques of the movie, and she directed the discussion a lot. We all talked about a lot of different topics of the documentary such as the politics and laws and the impact of those things. She was ready, clear, and understood the documentary."
"44","NOOR O SHAHIN","Was great at remembering interviewees names and affiliations. Made some really good connections between different group members thoughts and questions."
"45","PAIGE M KRAMER","Paige talked about ingroups and outgroups, stereotypes, and cinematography. she was very well prepared with a lot of notes from the documentary. she also tied different parts of the documentary into what she was saying. "
"46","PAIGE M KRAMER","This student had good knowledge on the subject both from the film and text book knowledge enough to communicate thoughts during the seminar."
"47","RUBY K ANDERSON","Ruby focused her paper on one specific area of the movie, but she had a good knowledge of the entire film. She communicated very clearly and concisely and was able to pull facts from different sources as well about the text. Good job, Ruby!!!"
"48","RUBY K ANDERSON","I honestly don't remember what they said much. I just was listening without paying too much attention to who said what. Just give them what everyone else gave them, I'm not a reliable source."
"49","RUBY K ANDERSON","Very clear and comfortable in conversation. Focused on filming techniques a bit."
"50","SAFFANA AHMED","Saffana did a good job discussing her views on racism as an outsider-as she is from another country and had no idea about the deep issues plaguing our country. She could have tied her ideas more to what we have learned about cognitive psych but overall did a great job discussing the connections she made"
"51","SAFFANA AHMED","Hi Saffana, thanks for being in our seminar group!  I really valued your broad observations--including that, despite being directed by a female filmmaker, statistics don't include females and neither does it focus much on violence/injustice against African-American women.  Your thought sand anecdote about stereotypes and obedience was also clarifying.  It seemed like you had certainly watched the documentary with a careful analysis, so I would have awarded full marks if you were able to share more about your perceptions/observations during seminar."
"52","SAFFANA AHMED","I was worried at first that you might not know the text as well as the rest of the group as you were relatively quiet and dealt with small sections of the text. However as the discussion progressed you were able to go back into the text in ways that we were able to continue our conversation on a topic. Just putting out an idea on a section of text material is good in this setting as it gets the entire group talking about it"
"53","TIFFANY CARPENTER","Good job Tiffany! You came prepared for this discussion and were very successful in using your knowledge of the text to connect your ideas with other group member's ideas, which required you to make broad connections of overarching themes and depth connections where you had to make sure that the two concepts were built on similar principles or where the differences occurred."
"54","TIFFANY CARPENTER","Tiffany did an amazing job giving deep details and connections between the film and our readings. She asked thought provoking questions to push the conversation. She did an incredible job keeping us on task and guiding the conversation when it lagged. She presented ideas from the film that no one else picked up on, deep analysis of the imagry"
"55","TIFFANY CARPENTER","Well-observer. Deply thought about certain terms like ""obedience"" and ""conformity"". Clear and very well presentable and an active listener."
"56","ZACHARY A COSTA","Zack did an amazing job of analyzing the film and offering a lot of information that I did not previously pick up on. He was able to contribute to all different pieces of the conversation clearly and showed that he had obviously taken the time to truly think deeply about the film. "
"57","ZACHARY A COSTA","I liked your essay topic. We all had a similar topic but you added a little more to yours ( about the government branch) so it was fun to talk about what you thought about that. You talked a lot and had good and constructive things to say. "
"58","ZACHARY A COSTA",""
"59","BRYLIA NGAWING","Brylia had a lot of connections to share on stereotypes and different types of leaders. She was also able to connect on other ideas, but especially these two."
"60","BRYLIA NGAWING","Good participation, some important information has been shared by her."
"61","BRYLIA NGAWING",""
"62","CHENQI GAO","Chengi didn't speak much but when she did I understood what she meant clearly.  She talked about media, stereotypes, and cinematography. She was not very prepared because she didn't finish her paper before the seminar. "
"63","CHENQI GAO","She brought how people in the film were framed and how different people were behind different backdrops"
"64","CHENQI GAO","This student brought a different topic to the table and had very good input on the cinematic set up of the film which was nice because I did to recognize this when I watched it. Although that was all that was contributed from this student and nothing else was really said."
"65","CONSTANCE A SNOWDEN","She brought up attitudes of the prison system and how it's been a way to keep minorities in the out group"
"66","CONSTANCE A SNOWDEN","Constance talked about influence, attitudes, and the prison system. she was very clear in that I didn't have many questions for her when she spoke. "
"67","HE YAO",""
"68","HE YAO","Mavis was very active in the discussion in asking clarifying questions, which I think helped everyone in the group fully clarify and form their thoughts on the event. Her points on how important historical context is to shaping modern racism also connected to my ideas very well. I enjoyed her commentary on the movie and although she was quite as well, her points and her contributions definitely meant a lot. "
"69","HE YAO","He Yao did a great job of both actively listening, but also joining into the conversation as well. She did a great job of asking a lot of interesting questions that were relevant to the film, but also kept the conversation interesting and active. "
"70","HE YAO","I wasn't exactly sure if you had written the essay, I don't know if maybe you're a shy person or there is a language barrier; but you seemed to struggle to tell us what your essay topic was. It would have been nice to hear a little more from you, but you did add some things to say here and there during the seminar. "
"71","JACE U MARSHALL","They didn't talk at all during the seminar!"
"72","JACE U MARSHALL","Unfortunately , Jace had not watched the documentary or prepared a paper for the seminar. He mainly listened to others in the group."
"73","JACE U MARSHALL","Jace did not contribute to the discussion at all. He seems disinterested in the discussion."
"74","JEANETTE ITA","Jeanette's analysis was more so around the information within the film. She went into the televisions power and how the black population has been portrayed within the American society. "
"75","Kennan Knudson",""
"76","MADISON M TSUKADA","I knew right away what your essay topic was about. You went into detail about what your topic was and the connections you made in the movie versus what we have learned in class. You kept the conversation going and always on topic. For example talking about the gorilla video.  "
"77","MADISON M TSUKADA",""
"78","MADISON M TSUKADA","Madison contributed throughout the entirety of the discussion like me, which was nice. Whenever someone brought up a point, she tried to make a connection to either a scene in the movie (such as bringing up the ALEC representative when another classmate brought up the contradictions of ALEC) or to her own essay, which was connect to ""We're in Trouble"" and the Stereotypes Psych text. She was probably the most prepared out of the group, or was at the very least the most likely to share the connection she was making with the entire group, which very much helped the seminar flow correctly. "
"79","MARCO SALIM",""
"80","MARCO SALIM","Quiet, but made a great effort to come out of his shell and connect with the discussion and questions posed."
"81","ROWAN E DOWELL","Clarity and depth was clear and on point. Lot of information from other sources. Reminded us some of the history of slavery and ""critical thinking "" was there."
"82","ROWAN E DOWELL","Rowan did an amazing job guiding the conversation and asking critical thinking questions. He had his computer up with the text version of the film for quick access to quotes. He guided the conversation and was quick to find online examples of clarification to our discussion. He made deep connections between the movies and the texts we have read."
"83","ROWAN E DOWELL","Hi Rowan, thanks for being part of our seminar group!  Your contributions (especially the Text-Hound ones) really helped progress the conversation.  Your commentary regarding the communal nature of the drum beats and poly-rhythmic nature of African music was great--thanks for sharing what you learned in the world music class.  You also raised some mathematical questions about how the statistics of the documentary might have been portrayed in a slightly biased way, and asked how population growth (especially of the black demographic over the white demographic) might affect the numbers (either now or in the future).  Thanks!"
"84","SONG-MEI H RALPH","Song-Mei unfortunately didn't have the chance to watch the video, as she was absent on Thursday when we watched it in class and didn't have access via Netflix to watch it. However, when we talked about the subject matter she was able to provide great commentary on the Social Psych aspects that we discussed in the Seminar. She was able to help us break down maybe why certain cinematic decisions were made in the film and the effect that they had on the audience. "
"85","SONG-MEI H RALPH","Hadn't watched the film but started watching during the seminar and interjected somewhat frequently despite little familiarity with the specifics."
"86","SONG-MEI H RALPH","They didn't have a chance to view the movie, so I feel bad giving them a low score. My review should probably be ignored... For all of them...
I'm bad at giving reviews."
"87","SONG-MEI H RALPH","She hadn't watched the movie but she still did her best to contribute to the discussion"
"88","JUNWEI FENG","I believe that Jun Wei's knowledge about this topic is broad, but understanding that his first language is not english, he did not talk much about what he wrote. He is a good encourager, but he did try very hard to support our argument with providing examples. "
"89","JUNWEI FENG","Junwei did a really good job bringing up connections, it would be nice if he was able to expand on some of the other member's ideas a little more as well."
"90","JUNWEI FENG","Tried hard, information delivered successfully."
"91","MIGNON X THURMOND","Mimi discussed how the systems are set up with in such a way that they perpetuate one an other to stay active. And how it is increasingly difficult to dismantle one system because they all rely heavily on one another. "
"92","MIGNON X THURMOND","provided good insight and was pretty prepared"
"93","SHARON M SELBY","They did their research too, I'm quite sure they pulled something up as context. No one in our group used the time stamp for any particular part, so that doesn't matter. It was nice having them in our group, because they were neither too talkative or too quiet. Once again, I don't remember exactly what they brought up."
"94","SHARON M SELBY","Again brought in great evidence from the documentary and was very knowledgeable about more loosely connected concepts"
"95","SHARON M SELBY","Sharon did an excellent job on this exercise. She went above and beyond, watching the interview with Oprah associated with the documentary and did research on all the people who were interviewed, so she was able to provide feedback on who these people were and what their background was outside of the context of the film. "
"96","SHARON M SELBY","Rating myself. Weird. I felt more comfortable than usual and spoke a lot. I did lots of research and discussed some of it with the group. I had to review my focus and reasoning behind it and wasn't as comfortable when conflict arose related to my assertion that privilege blindness is detrimental to our country's voting habits. Maybe I didn't quite get my point across or maybe people felt guilty for not ""doing enough"" and thus felt judged. The conversation shifted before we got into much detail on this."
