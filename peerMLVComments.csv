","I wasn't there for Rowan's shift during the MLV seminar but during the meetings we had as a group he showed a strong knowledge base on the topic so I have no reason to believe it was any different.  Rowan can also be credited with the topic in its entirety.  I learned a great deal about the movement."
"129","ROWAN E DOWELL","- summarized the history of the movements

"147","SHIELLINE PESIK","research, mlv poster, analysis","I was able to do some research and provide some sources, and because I only did some parts of the analysis and wasn't able to make it to several classes, I offered to make the mlv poster in return for my absences and tardiness of work.

"148","SHIELLINE PESIK","formatting presentation","Sheilline wasn't always there in person as a result of family obligations and emergencies, however she was always keeping up to date with what was going on.

"153","SONG-MEI H RALPH","She helped correct some of the work that went on the poster.","Song-Mei did very little for this project and continuously made herself seem irresponsible and undependable.

"156","SONG-MEI H RALPH","MLV application, poster supplies, concept definitions","I often felt intimidated by my peers. Volunteering to do things was sometimes hard because often the other person would respond with ""I got this,"" although not unkindly it did sometimes make me feel useless. Sometimes it was hard to work in my group. I always felt like I was on a different wavelength for some reason. I know I didn't make it to all of the meetings, I had a lot of emergencies and personal matters come up this quarter. Overall my group was really fun to work with. Next time I'm going to work to be less in the background, however I don't want to be that person who gets stuck doing all the work because no one else will. Group work is really hard for me, this pushed me way out of my comfort zone."

"167","ZACHARY A COSTA","Thesis statement, analyses of media sources, basically most of the writing.","They did a great job, I feel as though they did a lot of the hard work, doing the analyses. Honestly, the only one I would give them less than perfect is with timeliness of work, and that's just because they're a busy person. I just feel weird giving people perfect scores, but I honestly would if I didn't feel weird about it. They were probably the main reason we won that award."
"168","ZACHARY A COSTA","Check what I did for the class presentation.","Check what I did for the class presentation."
"169","ZACHARY A COSTA","Completed the entire poster outline, which included reading and analyzing each of the three articles, connecting this analysis into one thesis, writing an introduction, writing the background information, and concluding everything into a ""so what?"". Stayed with the poster for 2 hours.","Analysis produced was vital to the poster's creation. Outside of the definitions, if it was written on the poster, it was written by myself. Besides that, I felt I was talkative in group discussions and always contributed ideas when I could."
