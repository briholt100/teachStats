5/29/2017 23:45:04,Alena Markins,"I definitely could have done more reading, as I did not finish all of it. However, I feel like I did a really good job being the ""text hound"" and trying to keep people referring back to the text as much as possible. There were a lot of complexities and I really enjoyed delving into them and seeing how the texts tied together. As always, being able to reflect my interpretation of the text brought out a lot of responses from others and enabled me to think about the text in ways I hadn't thought before. 

This time was a bit weird because I felt like I could relate to the text more than I did with 13th. I think this also ended up leading to our sidetracking a bit because we could all relate to it more than 13th, though it helped to be able to tie this material in with other material we've studied. 

One thing that I think I did very well was to patiently remind people about going back to the text. I was able to reiterate why it was important to quote exactly what is being said so that we all could provide our interpretations of what was said in the text and what it meant.

Staying on track was much harder this time, as we didn't have any questions to focus us on the text and there was a LOT to pull from. Also, I might have missed it, but I don't remember knowing how much time we were supposed to be allotted for the seminar, so it felt very long. ",ERIKA M GLUNZ,1,1,1,"Erika came to class with a well-highlighted textbook. She was able to tie a lot of things together in her analyses of the materials not only to the social psych work that we did in class, but also to analyses other students made about the texts. She communicated very well what she was thinking to us. The only thing I could think that would help her to communicate better is to be able to go back to the text so that everyone can see exactly what the author was trying to say, hear Erika's interpretation of what it meant, then be able to discuss why that was relevant and what it tied to. ",GABRIELLE M PITZLER,1,1,1,"Gabrielle brought a lot to the table when it came to communicating about the text. I can't remember exact specifics because that was several days ago, but she did a great job linking social psych concepts we learned about to the text. Gabrielle also showed herself to be a great listener, picking up what others were trying to communicating and responding well to it. ",MARCELLA V TASLIM,2,2,2,"I have a hard time evaluating Marcella, and I think that was partially our (the group's) fault. There were several extroverted people in our group and I know we spoke over Marcella when we were having a discussion, even when I attempted to get her to speak out after noticing we didn't leave much breathing room for our quieter group members. It seemed like Marcella's interpretation of the text was good, but I want to hear more from her. Some feedback that I can give her to help her participate more is to suggest that maybe she practice speaking with a friend or someone she trusts and try to assert herself more when she's being spoken over. This is a super hard thing to do, and I have trouble with it when I'm speaking with someone who intimidates me, but practicing several times in a low-pressure situation helps a bunch!  ",RUBY K ANDERSON,1,1,1,"Ruby was on track! She did a great job of tying things together, and had a great understanding of the text. Her interpretation of the Occupy movement and how it tied to the events in the 60s helped me understand a lot. She also made suggestions on things we could focus on to help us distill our interpretation of the text. One thing I would suggest is working on actively listening more next time and giving others room to talk.",SHARON M SELBY,1,1,1,"Whoo! Damn, Sharon! She did a great job with this seminar. She brought a lot of insight into the way these systems work, and was able to tie it back to her own movement and the legitimacy of reporting on bathroom/trans rights bills. ",ZACHARY A COSTA,1,1,1,"Zach did a great job and brought some really insightful thoughts into the text. I would like to hear more from him next time, if we're in a group together again.",Kennan Knudson,3,3,3,"Note: the scores above are meant to be neutral place holders in case I have to answer them and are not at all indicative of any evaluation of Kennan's performance. Also, I only chose Kennan's name on here because it was the first teacher name I saw as I was scrolling down trying to find a place to give feedback for the actual session. 

I said it on Thursday, but I wanted to put it here so that it's easier to remember. Next time we do a seminar, it would be super helpful to have more information about things we could focus on. The prompt this time was pretty nebulous for the amount of reading we had to do, so it was very difficult to choose a direction and stick with it without getting sidetracked. Additionally, it would be helpful at the beginning of the session if we were told exactly how long we were going to be working on our seminars (though I fully admit this might have been stated in class and our group was just jumping in without listening to directions).

One thing that I just thought of, though, was that it would be good to review, quickly, before we split up into groups next time, the three things about interpreting a text: what it says, what it means, and why that's important. When our group was able to do that, I felt like we were able to all stay on track and better interpret the texts.

I'm also a bit proponent of just splitting up into 4 groups and pulling the walls out. That's something we can do during our lunch time so that it doesn't take up too much class time (pulling out the walls). I'm pretty sure my group did a lot to contribute to the noise level.  "
5/25/2017 22:19:04,Alicia Gehring," For this seminar I discussed the medias involvement in shaping the movements, group dynamics and how privilege was used within each movement. I feel like I talked a lot in the seminar, and pehpps me, Conner and Mimi dominated the conversation. I wasn't sure how to get the other two girls involved in the discussion. When there was a lull in the conversation I tried asking for specific information. 
At times the conversation seemed a bit repetitive as well as redundant. We seemed to cover each text multiple times. It may have served me better if I would have specific places in the text to reference my arguments. ",CONNOR J PARENTEAU,1,1,1,"Although, he did not have the precise places in the text marked for his argument, I would say he still was able to articulate what he saw within the text. His primary connection was the symbiotic relationship between the media and the movements. ",MIGNON X THURMOND,1,1,1,"Her main connections in the text, and thus talking points for the discussion were the how the media and the movement interact and thus influence each other. she also brought up ""group think"" as well as other group processes. I believe she was the one in the group to bring up prejudices and stereotyping on the angle the media chooses to run the story.",JEANETTE ITA,2,3,3,"Her primary talking point was the relationship between the media and the movements. She put to words the idea that the movements don't generally get the coverage they need or want. She was relatively quiet through the conversation; however, her comments were usually well calculated and on point. ",IRENE THAJEB,2,4,3,She was fairly quiet thorough the conversation ,MARY-AN VAN-VALKENBURG,,,,No show for this exercise. I'm not quit sure what else to say with that. I am only adding her here because the survey will not let me continue without putting a name in this slot.,,,,,,,,,,
5/28/2017 14:00:51,Amy Mason,I feel good about my participation in the group seminar. I was able to share my connections and relate them to connections and thoughts of other group members. I think if I had reread the passages I would have been a little more prepared.,BILLY DE-LA-VEGA,1,1,1,"Billy was a really good group facilitator, he kept our conversations on track and made sure everyone was able to contribute to the conversation.",ALEXANDER J GRAY,1,1,1,Alex did a really good job connecting our reading to social psych concepts and connecting them with other group members' ideas.,PAIGE M KRAMER,1,1,1,Paige was able to add a lot to the group's conversation and was able to cite exact pieces of our readings.,SONG-MEI H RALPH,1,1,1,Song Mei did a really good job bringing clarity to the advances in media in regards to our reading and making connections to others.,BING-RUI CHANG,1,1,2,"Max was able to bring a new light to the group regarding his experience in a different country, he was able to focus a lot of the growth of countries. ",,,,,,,,,,
5/29/2017 16:43:09,Billy De La Vega ,"In the group seminar I found that I was the Facilitator. I directed the conversation and for the most part made sure the group stayed on topic and used the seminar time to only discuss and reflect on all the text that we read. As far as being prepared i did real all text and contributed at least for claims with supporting detail. so i did have more than enough material to contribute constructively. 
 ",AMY M MASON,1,2,2,Great contribution w/supporting text. did a very great job with close reading and was able to defend and support her claims with great connections from material we have learned in class as well as from the text. ,ALEXANDER J GRAY,2,1,2,"Great job using material that we have learned in class and making strong connections to the text. (priming, semantics,groups) ect. In terms of group participation if Alex can remember to stay on topic and go with the flow of the group, it would benefit the focus and direction of seminar a lot better. ",BING-RUI CHANG,4,3,3,"Bing did an amazing job making connections of social groups in the US. back to his home country. His reflection really brought a different perspective to the seminar group. I would have liked for Bing to find a few more talking points and text to show his knowledge of the text! I did like that he participated a great amount, even though he was hesitant t share he still made a valiant effort to be apart of the group discussion. ",SONG-MEI H RALPH,4,4,4,I felt as though Song was ill prepared for the seminar. While her dramatic efforts were appreciated when piggy- backing off of other group members ideas: that method of participation doesn't really give a vital direction in her knowledge of the text. Great effort chiming in when she could and offering her personal thoughts to keep the conversation in motion. ,PAIGE M KRAMER,3,3,3,Page made  a clear connection to  IN-OUT groups but i felt that was the extent of the connections to class and Psych that she found prior to the seminar. ,,,,,,,,,,
5/29/2017 20:58:29,Bing-Rui Chang,"In this discussion, I was the only international student, so we did not see the same thing or focusing on different things in this topic, but that's why it makes the discuss interesting. 

Billy and Alice share that the media changed the current movement, especially how media spreads by social media from a country to another country. And I respond that sometime we (Taiwanese) see a movement that happens in America by Facebook,  and people copy it and  starting a similar movement in other places. This is an example of how media can be spreads by media. Moreover, I share the connection between Occupy Movement and New Left Movement that both movement have clear goal but not a clear solution.  

In conclusion, I believe that I'm doing well and clear during the group discussion. Although that we see the different things from the same essay, but our discussion was rich. We discussed from local (Seattle movement) to national (New York) , and global (Taiwan). ",AMY M MASON,1,1,1,"Amy is very active during the discussion, she share her point of view and respond what she thinks to other people's ideas. Also, she is very respect to other students, especially international student like me, because usually we view things differently. ",SHIHAO MEI,1,1,1,"People share the ideas of this topic and some ideas relate to American history. And she was really helpful of explaining it to me since I have no US history background. Also, she is a Chinese but was adopts by American, so she was very active and curious about global movement. I enjoy to have her in the group.",BILLY DE-LA-VEGA,1,1,1,"In my opinion, Billy is like the leader of the discussion, which is always a good thing that have a leader in the group.  Sometime when we bring the topic way to far, and Billy will remind us to got back to the topic. Also, Billy share the ideas of how media spread the movement and differences of movement in the  1960's and now. I like Billy's work which is clear and interested to me.",ALEXANDER J GRAY,2,1,1,"Alex knows about the text really well, and the connections are clear and interesting. However, Alex have some stereotypes when we discuss about global topic. For example, I was explaining that how Taiwan's movement affects by America's movement and Alice always relate to political issues. It is good to have patriotism, but sometime it is good to open mind and listen what people that are from different culture background think about same topic, because sometime we arrive in different conclusion. However, beside that ,Alex is pretty active in the group and respond really well about other people. And it's good to have him in the group.",PAIGE M KRAMER,1,1,1,"Paige is very active in the group,also very well respond to other people and deeply knows about the text. For example, when we arrive in a conclusion about the text and he can point out a quote from the book that support and explains the conclusion, including the page number. This helps the discussion more clear. And I enjoy to have her in the group. ",,,,,,,,,,
5/29/2017 22:29:38,Bryan Vargas,"I usually feel I could have been better prepared after most assignments, quizzes, or tests so this seminar was no different. I felt I had a fairly good grasp of the material in the reading assignment and was able to articulate a few points.

But, as the conversation amongst other students developed I noticed there were quite a few things I left out or didn't think of. On occasion I can recognize certain behaviors or ideas from the social psych text but can't quite find the right nomenclature to properly identify it and elaborate more. ",MADISON M TSUKADA,1,1,1,Madison came prepared and articulated her points well over many portions of the reading assignments.,YAJUN CAO,2,2,2,Cajon voiced her points clearly and referenced multiple readings during the presentation.,CHIA-YU LIU,1,2,2,CHIA-YU was clear and used multiple sections of the readings to articulate her views.,BRYLIA NGAWING,,,,Brylia communicated clearly and referenced many parts of the reading assignment.,YI-FANG LIN,2,2,2,Yi-Fang communicated well and expressed multiple views clearly.,HE YAO,1,2,2,He was able to clearly communicate her views based on the readings.

5/31/2017 12:34:11,Brylia Ngawing,"I participated well in the seminar, but not as active as I was before when the members were less than 5. I guess I can't really talk that much when there are more people because I think slower and can't pace up with people's thoughts. I was the one that brought up untouch topics and keep asking people what else to talk about. I was the one that started the seminar by stating the main idea of both articles from my point of view.
Maybe I could be more prepared if i read the texts beforehand. Maybe bringing the physical form of the articles can make me cite them clearly.",MADISON M TSUKADA,1,1,1,"Clarity--Madison speaks clearly and stated her main ideas clearly.

5/29/2017 23:49:29,Chenqi Gao,"    I mainly focused on two parts. The first part is to talk about the relationship between political and mass media. The mass media and political are kind of marriage for me after done of reading the three articles. I gave specific examples to support my idea, but my examples are not specific enough. And I should talk more about the readings. I can relate the readings to the mass media. To talking more from the readings. 
    The other thing I talked in my seminar essay is that the pictures used in the reading named ""We Are Many"". It is pretty impressive. The author made a good usage of psychological. ",NOOR O SHAHIN,1,1,2,"Noor has a very clear thought, and she used specific examples from each readings. I really like the idea of the role of media in the readings. She alwasy has the great idea in the group decision.",SHIHAO MEI,1,1,1,Shihao has a great point of the economic part. He has a deep thought in the second reading. He related economic and media influences very well.,CONSTANCE A SNOWDEN,1,2,1,"She has an excellent point of the media influences. She gave the group specific details of her paper. The readings are long, but she broke them into parts which makes people easy to understand.",KESHA L HOWARD,2,1,1,Kesha has great points. Her essay kind of has everything in there.

5/28/2017 14:06:29,Chia-Yu Liu,"The entire seminar was very successful and we got everyone contributing their thoughts and ideas about various of topics that we covered on Thursday. Personally, for myself I felt I did participate than last time, I am well more confident to speak and split out my perspective. Additionally, I am more willing to challenge my teammate thoughts to generate a deep thoughtful conclusion. Additionally, I covered how media had been used in our society in terms of pros and cons. 

Personally, for the future seminar, I am looking forward to leading a longer discussion rather than being a contributor. By achieving this goal it practiced my leadership skills and to speak in a more mild and indirect way either both compliment or dress down. In conclude, it was a successful seminar and there were lots of takeaways, and I am looking forward to our next seminar.

5/27/2017 10:56:02,Connor Parenteau,I believe I was well prepared enough to complete the seminar but I could have taken a little more time to write down important points from my paper to go off of instead of pulling them from memory. Having notes in front of me would have made the conversations flow easier and keep the discussions on track a little more. I would say I facilitated the group discussion decently well by driving the conversation toward the key points mentioned by everyone in the beginning. I wrote down what everyone said their main point was and then we just segwayed from point to point relatively smoothly. I think it was a great seminar and better than the first one. The one thing I would do differently is writing down my own key points before hand to help with lulls in the conversation between the group. ,ALICIA L GEHRING,1,1,1,"Although Alicia sometimes rushes through explanations she also made some great points in her part of the seminar. She was the only one who brought up how privilege affects who participates in movements and how it also effects how people view the movement based on that privilege. The only thing to work on for her would be to just slow down a bit, it will help her articulate her very interesting views. ",IRENE THAJEB,1,2,1,"Once we got into the conversation it became more apparent that Irene knows a lot about the readings and the main points of the seminar. She was prepared enough to continue talking points from our groups discussion but wasn't prepared to create a new thread of discussion on her own, its a bit nit picky but the group was awesome in general so I have to find something :) ",JEANETTE ITA,1,1,1,Jeanette made an interesting point about the media not covering the movement for what it is but rather how exciting it can be and then explained that this keeps the general public from hearing what it is actually about. Her points were great once we got her to open up and take part in the discussion. It is hard for people to share ideas with peers because its always in the back of our minds that someone is going to think your points are stupid. If she could get passed the initial nervousness than she will be great at seminaring!,MIGNON X THURMOND,1,1,1,I have had Mimi in both seminar groups now and enjoy the discussion that ensues. She brought up a lot of interesting things and built upon those that have already been said. She made a great point about how the media made people feel by comparing the SDS movement and Occupy movements. This lead to lengthy discussion on the social psych aspects of media power. Very good seminar buddy!,MARY-AN VAN-VALKENBURG,,,,She was supposed to be in our discussion group but was not present for the seminar.,,,,,,,,,,
5/29/2017 23:30:02,Constance Snowden,"This seminar for myself was tough, for the r4eason that the text we were to read were very dense. My group dove right into the text with our own perspectives of the different text. All in all the understanding of the course text was helpful to further the understanding of the text that I originally did not understand. What made this seminar harder was the struggle I had on my own reading the text and reading with an understanding of the connection between the media and the government. So overall I think I could have taken better notes of the text while I'm reading. 
",NOOR O SHAHIN,1,1,1,,CHENQI GAO,3,3,4,Did not have a whole lot to say about text and mainly stayed in the same area of text.,KESHA L HOWARD,1,2,1,,SHIHAO MEI,5,5,5,,Brian Holt,3,3,3,It would let me lick ahead without doing this.,,,,,,,,,,

They also encouraged the quite ones to talk.",,,,,,,,,,
5/26/2017 15:44:10,Erika Glunz,"I feel like I did a much better job in this seminar now that I understand the roles and the process better. I tried harder this time to focus on being an active listener and trying to connect themes between the psych reading and the texts for this seminar. I felt I made good connections but was also open to hearing from others and fitting that in with my ideas.
I did find this seminar harder in the sense that the group was so large sometimes one side of the group would begin discussing one thing and the other half another. It was harder to keep on track than with a smaller group. I also felt the time allotted for this seminar was too long and it was hard to stay on topic for over an hour straight. ",ALENA N MARKINS,1,2,1,Alena did a great job keeping our group on task and making sure everyone got a chance to speak. They were also the text hound and made sure everyone was on the same page. They admitted they did not do much of the reading which would be my only critique. ,MARCELLA V TASLIM,2,3,3,When given an opportunity to speak uninterrupted she had good ideas and connections. I understand it was harder to fully understand the texts while not having a full understanding of theses movements or history. ,ZACHARY A COSTA,1,1,1,Zac did a great job participating in our group and provided interesting points. He had a deep understanding of the texts and I could tell he came prepared,RUBY K ANDERSON,1,1,1,Ruby did an amazing job contributing to our group. She made interesting connections between the text and past readings. She was very enthusiastic and I very much enjoyed her presence in our group. ,GABRIELLE M PITZLER,1,1,1,Gabrielle did an incredible job in our group and helped us find the social psych terms we were discussing. She was quick to look something up and give us accurate definitions of what we were discussing. She also brought up great talking points. Good job!,SHARON M SELBY,1,1,1,"I very much enjoyed Sharon's presence in our group. She brought up great points that were also very deep. She made connections between the movements and a famous Gandhi quote. She also focused on the framing aspect discussed in ""the whole world is watching"". I could tell she came prepared and worked hard to make broad connections. Thanks!",,,,,
5/26/2017 11:18:31,Gabrielle Pitzler,"I could have been better prepared, I didn't have the seminar assignment completed upon arrival of class. I had some brief bullet points that were mainly connections to the social psych online book. I would throw in my two cents about what was happening from a social psych perspective as the group discussed the text. In one or two instances I brought us to a certain area in the article We are Many and talk about the connections I saw there. Other than that I was intrigued and listening to the many directions this group took the discussion. ",ALENA N MARKINS,1,1,1,"Alena was a great text-hound, she kept us honest on where or what we were referring to. This helped the whole group stay on the same page and because it helped us slow down and focus, new connections were thought of and spoken. She also made sure that people who were more shy had a time to shine in the seminar. ",ERIKA M GLUNZ,1,1,1,"Erika was well prepared and had a lot of passion in the seminar, she was one of the reasons we were buzzing with so much energy. It was fun and validating when she could connect what others were saying to something else which allowed us to dive deeper in the conversation. She could even connect what we were saying to an entirely new point in a completely different article. ",MARCELLA V TASLIM,1,2,2,"Marcella was a quiet listener, but when given the room to speak she enhanced our conversation by asking really good clarifying questions. She brought a whole new perspective to the table as she is not from this country and really wants to understand what these movements are all about. She wasn't afraid to point out that she had a hard time relating to our history here in America, and that made the interactions and our thoughts (or at least mine) deepen in a more global sense. ",RUBY K ANDERSON,1,1,1,Ruby was great at listening and responding to the conversation as it flowed. Her input extended the conversation flow and allowed us to connect the text to other assignments and projects we have done in the class thus far. Her connections between media and the women's march and 13th and how the media was treating SDS and Occupy helped us to relate to the text more. Some of us weren't even born yet when they occurred and she helped facilitate a clearer perspective and connection.,SHARON M SELBY,1,1,1,"Sharon came very prepared and brought great passion and questions to the table. She related concepts and connections we made to other movements. She was really good at being a conversationalist and responding to everyone around the table equally. Her references kept us focused on the articles at hand and was always bringing in new thoughts. She was a great at taking a narrow focus and broadening it or taking a broad focus and narrowing it, this allowed us to really learn more as we talked. ",ZACHARY A COSTA,1,1,1,Zac was balanced at active listening and contributing to the conversation. He brought up great points and was excellent at validating each of our contributions while adding in his own connections to text in response. He helped create two way conversation keeping the subjects always moving and evolving. ,,,,,
5/29/2017 23:23:23,He Yao,"I think I did much preparation as I can in a limit time before this seminar. I had a hard time of the first reading - ""The Whole World is Watching"".

As all of us have pretty much the same point, I did not have much to say when it was my turn to speak up. Also since it was my first seminar group activity, I was a little bit nervous and I ended up speaking too fast, keeping everything short and agreeing to other people's point, sometimes adding little things to their points.

(Pg27. Paragraph (2) – Reporters started seeking out the leaders to cover news stories, (Todd Gitlin) I was really concerned that the reports was why strong activist was being murdered due to location being comprise by media coverage.  In the film “13th Amendment” this statement stood out about activist being labeled and being placed in a box that was negative, 11:06 – Black activist was labeled as criminals and told lies that the activist was deliberately violating the laws. (13th Amendment) I feel that media can feed the uneducated and undecided on views by showing coverage that would be harmful to the movement by creating controversial stories that goes against movement to get rating if its true facts or not just to get the story out. I also tied the Black Lives Matter movement to this article as well due to lies being told and the motives are question about the movement on police brutality when the proof is obvious by the images and stories being film by citizens in United States across America. It makes me think of the lecture on the introduction to attribution theory were the blame or cause. I thought of Internal attribution that dealing with personality that causes behaviors and media has various personality that could voices their bias thoughts across millions of lives by having access to air waves.   

  (Pg. 26 Paragraph (3) – The prevailing attitudes towards the mass media were disdain and suspicion. (Todd Gitlin). I feel if you don’t know yourself or aware than conformity can be powerful force in getting you to follow what social pressures in society to fit in to be liked. In this article is a great example of conformity by saying if you don’t follow how we think then your rebel or a problem. Humans are influence by people around us so by only hear a one-sided story isn’t democracy at all. 
					Occupy Nations
(Pg22. Paragraph (2) Image) – As I look at this chapter I ran across a picture that explain in a nut shell how this movement felt about corporation moguls. Here is a quote from protester in image “When did campaign finance reform mean corporations get to BUY our Leaders?  I thought about how media shows images or stories that can charge your ideas or dismantle and this article it seems that this issue is still a problem and with the last president campaign on who they wanted for president by airing false facts made up content to insure success of another candidate is exactly what big corporation want to control our thinking process. I notice that certain media network would only show Republican candidate in great light but showing liberal democratic issues as costing millions to the deficit and creating problems for the rich. It depends on class or status in United States and once you’re at that place everyone should think alike due to being moguls in society.   
					We Are Many
(Pg. 178. Paragraph (1) “Occupy space where, in most of the hustle and bustle of that park when it was occupied.” People who identify as people of color talk through their experiences in dealing with unfair treatment. Occupy movement was trying to find ways to help the impacts of color and organizing and being more political consciousness, by working together to solve the issue facing people of color community. When reading this article, it fits right into the Black Lives Matter movement ties into this movement in many ways but reformed agendas requests for the new era. Giving a community safe spaces is gold when it’s dangerous elsewhere. The movement also had similarity by trying to figure out how we can make it better but also showing images that shows the black experiences in United States.

5/29/2017 14:08:13,Madison Tsukada,"The main aspect of the seminar that I participated in was making sure that the conversation kept going. I talked a lot about how the media really can change an organization through it's twisted truth. For instance, the choice of photo that was used to show the protest against the Vietnam War versus those who were for the war. Since they chose a photograph that made the two sides look even, even though the side that was against the war was a lot bigger, this can lead to the other side actually gaining more people because of they fake size of the group. This is because of the ingroup and outgroup concept, people are willing to take a stance if they see that a lot of other people are taking a stance as well.
I also started a rather large conversation about how the SDS became radical because of the media coverage of the group. Since SDS started out as a group that was no where near radical, it's rather surprising that this is what they are know for today. All of this is because of the way the media chose to cover them. The media was only willing to cover something if there were arrest involved and the only thing that would warrant arrest are radical actions. This then attracted people who wanted to be a part of a radical group and so as more radical people joined, the more radical the group became. It was a rather interesting cycle.  ",YAJUN CAO,5,4,5,"Yajun maybe said two sentences during the entire seminar and sat on her phone the majority of the time.

I thought I prepared better but I get nervous and have a hard time catching up since we jump from one topic to another at a fast pace. I think I am just not good with talking people. It is hard for  me to connect to the readings even though I understand the main points. However, I don't have much knowledge of the history of the country and when people talk about terms that are normal, I have a hard time catching up.
Next seminar, I will probably prepare better and hopefully, just conquer my fear of talking with people. I have a hard time of gathering my thoughts to speak because I feel like what I spoke seems trivial or unimportant so I am not a big fan of speaking. However, I guess the point of the seminar is to conquer that fear and prepare you to speak and think critically which is something I still need work.

5/31/2017 16:05:22,Sharon Selby,"Honestly, I think I did quite well in this seminar. I was better prepared this time with a printout of my paper to refer to. The past few weeks of class have really broken me out of my social anxiety and my ability to be open with people about who I am. What’s weird is, sometimes I feel like I’m taking up too much space rather than being shy and quiet. It helped that our group had a really cohesive bond. The only issue I had that is duly noted was pointed out by Alena; wherein reading from a flowing text, I wasn’t immediately able to identify full passages and page numbers of material related to my points. Whether this is expected or not, being so prepared would be ideal.

I was able to cover all of the major points from my paper. I had drawn connections between the New Left and Occupy in relation to a couple of outside sources. First, the Gandhi quote, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then the fight you, then you win.” Aside from the “winning” part, I made points about the first three segments. Second, I noted a striking comparison between Gitlin’s framing devices and Julia Serano’s list of invalidations related to prejudice. The point was to argue that the press has been freely slandering political movements just as someone prejudiced might slander a person as the mechanisms are notably similar.

My final point was about how the protection of free speech has led us to a crossroads. We need to begin considering the point at which free speech becomes a tool of oppression by those privileged and/or in power seeking to freely take away the voice of minorities. The partisan press has help to normalize the level of incivility that has crept into society. Perhaps this has been a major point in all of my work recently; because while being conscious of one’s subjective position is important, it’s also important to see a limit to what is and isn’t civil discourse.

Although I didn’t speak as much as the other group members, I managed to still take part by asking questions and responding to several things. I wasn’t able to be fully confident and speak as much as I would like, because the material for this seminar (Occupy Nation and the New Left Movement) is very new to me and was quite challenging for me understand. I believe that I could participate more often if I was able to understand the movements even better. 

During the seminar, I had to really think about what I was going to say and make sure that it wouldn’t come out sounding silly. The other members seemed to know the material very well and was able to relate to the movements, which is something that came off quite intimidating to me.

I discover that those two events were happened in different time; however, they still have some similar points; for example, people feel unsatisfied about some corrupt companies or the unequal socials. Therefore, those two events both have the same problem that is unequal, and citizens cannot gain in the common right. Democratic always is a word be talked or promised by some governments, but the governments or some companies didn’t make them promise to come true. 
           In addition, our group also analysis the social media that give people some positive or negative influences, and we share our opinions. Some people consider that internet and media can immediately spread some important information or news; thus, it is benefit to people know some useful news. Nevertheless, others think some media doesn’t have enough authenticity and spread very rapid; thus, some people will blindly trust some fake news. The argument is useful for use to understand more about the social media.

I assume that it's because the lengthy articles made quoting and contextualizing much more involved, and in the process, some of my coherency was muddled.  (Maybe practicing my seminar points before would have helped, especially as some just came to me looking over the text again, and weren't included in my paper :) Because the Occupy Nation and other articles focused on a lot on media strategy, public perception, grassroots involvement, and many other facets of a movement, I was keen to hear more from my classmates about their perspective on the material, as well as how it felt to them psychologically.  As well as being genuinely curious about their views, I tried to participate primarily as an encourager to directly support some of our more quiet group members to become active.  With others' reflections on how the articles we read tend to represent Wall Street somewhat sympathetically, while also downplaying or not including other issues like adverse affects of racism or desperate circumstances of income inequality, I thought about how the ""2 and 1%"" have typically come to control corporate media, and how that would create a bias in their favor.

You were engaged with the texts and definitely tried to discuss it more deeply, especially regarding the individuals who ""occupied"" Wall Street and the power balance from a social psychology perspective.  Thanks!",EMILY B DERDA,1,1,1,"Emily, thanks for being part of our seminar group.

They did it so deeply, as they do have a lot of things to share and the connection with each article. We mostly talk about the article a lot. Somehow my mind is thinking about the thing that can relate to us now instead of the things we learned in the class. 
When I share my thought with the other, it is more toward the public instead of the classmate. I feel like I should work on that more. The part I regret the most is I wish I did more of advance reading than just read through it. The advance reading I am talking about is read it as paragraph to paragraph. Also, I wish I can speak up more, I am shy when I am in a group of people that I never talk to them before.

5/29/2017 13:14:23,Zachary Costa,"My participation this seminar was much less than last time, as the larger groups made it harder to find a chance to talk. However, I still made sure to help contribute to the group when the opportunity presented itself. For example, I brought up how Occupy Nation talked about media coverage of their movement and turned it into one of violence even though the police were the ones causing said violence. Additionally, I brought up some ideas from my seminar paper,  such as how the New York Times attempted to paint a very specific image of the 1960s anti-war movement by placing a photo of an equal number of nazi protesters against an equal number of anti-war protesters, even though the anti-war demonstrators outnumbered the nazis 50 to 1. I also indirectly helped by assisting Alena in being a text hound and making sure everyone was on the same page.
I could have improved this seminar by being a bit more vocal and making sure I had my voice heard when I had something to say. I also could have helped out more in making sure everyone had their voice heard too, since are group was quite loud and talkative, and I could tell it was overwhelming some people. Overall though I think my group was very analytical and that helped me contribute my seminar paper's ideas easily while also being able to have a few ""epiphany"" moments about the news media, which I shared with my group.

She also went further in reading around said page and trying to draw connections to what someone brought up from one paragraph to the paragraphs around it, or to other class reading we have done. These actions ensured we would stay on topic. Another great thing Alena did is she helped bring Marcella into the discussion, who is obviously more quiet but definitely did the reading. This was very kind as I think otherwise Marcella would have not been able to share due to the somewhat overwhelming nature of our group.",ERIKA M GLUNZ,1,1,1,"Erika started off our discussion by going over her seminar paper, which was about how the media can directly shape a movement in the eyes of an outside viewer. She also discussed how media can personally attack those who take apart in a movement in order to outgroup them to a reader. Overall Erika was one of our group's main contributors and always tried to further clarify and make sense of what other people had said, which was helpful not just for her but for the entire group.",SHARON M SELBY,1,1,1,"Sharon was one of the discussion powerhouses of our group. She was able to take the ideas brought up in the readings, and connect those ideas of the movement to ideas she had studied in transgender rights and issues. She also put emphasis on the ""frames"" brought up at the beginning of ""The Whole World is Watching"", which she said were important for understanding how a media source may be skewing their coverage of the movement. Finally, she discussed how much of the problematic language used by the media is often embedded in our culture, which is why having minority reporters help on pieces is important to keep them accurate.",MARCELLA V TASLIM,1,1,1,"Marcella was noticeably the most quiet in our group, and I can definitely understand why. Our group was very talkative and it was difficult to insert yourself into the conversation, even for someone loud like me. When she did speak, she talked about how the reading was hard for her to understand since she did not grow up in the United States, but she did ask a good clarifying question about the media which helped to spark further discussion among our group. Furthermore, while she was very quiet, I never felt like she was distracted or not paying attention - on the contrary, she was always listening and alert.",RUBY K ANDERSON,1,1,1,"Ruby made many connections between what are group members were mentioning they read and the real world. She was big on analysis; for example, she saw how rather than the media being biased for or against a movement, they probably just did not understand it, and found it easier to do a ""lazy"" report on the subject (which was generally negative) rather than fully understand it. Additionally, Ruby, like Gabrielle, shared some real-life implication of this kind of news media and how it can affect people in their everyday life.",,,,,
